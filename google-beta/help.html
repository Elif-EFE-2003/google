        <h2><font color="red" face="arial,helvetica"> Google queries are simple yet powerful </font></h2>
        
        To enter a query into Google, <b><font color="#38A808">just type in a
        few descriptive keywords and hit "search."</font></b> That's it!  If
        you need them, however, we also provide a few advanced search
        operators.
        
        <ul>
        <li><b><font color="red">NEW!</font> <font color="#38A808" face="arial,helvetica">The "" operator.
            </font></b>
               Google automatically prefers pages where
            the query terms are found in close proximity.  However, sometimes
            the only relevant pages are those where some or all of the query
            words occur as a phrase.  You can <b><font color="#38A808">enclose words
            in double-quotes</font></b> (<tt>"like this"</tt>) to force the words
            to appear together in all returned documents.
        </li><li><b><font color="red">NEW!</font> <font color="#38A808" face="arial,helvetica">The - operator.
            </font></b>
               Sometimes it is helpful to choose words to exclude from a search.
            That is, you want all relevant result pages except those containing
            a certain word.  We support this "not" functionality with the "-" operator.
            Simply <b><font color="#38A808">prefix your query word with a -</font></b>
            (<tt>-like -this</tt>) to make Google ignore all pages containing that
            word.
        </li><li><b><font color="#38A808" face="arial,helvetica">Automatic AND.
            </font></b> 
               Google only supports "and" queries. 
            That is, it only returns pages that include all the query terms.
            The + operator, which enforces "and" behavior on some search engines,
            is unnecessary on Google (though it can be used to include
            stopwords; see below).
        </li></ul>
        
        
        <h2><font color="red" face="arial,helvetica"> Do more than query </font></h2>
        
        The results of a Google search do a lot to help point you toward the
        right result: the <a href="legend.html">numbers in the results</a>
        help you figure out result quality, and the query word-sensitive
        content helps you figure out what the pages are about.<p>
        
        The results can also be used for further exploration of the web.
        Click on the bar graph at the beginning of the result, and see <b><font color="#38A808">what pages link to this page</font></b>.</p><p>
        
        Click on the "cached" link, and see what the <b><font color="#38A808">page looked like when we indexed it</font></b>.  Has the
        page changed so much it doesn't hold the information you need anymore?
        Perhaps the version in the cache will be more helpful.
        
        
        </p><h2><font color="red" face="arial,helvetica"> Feeling lucky? </font></h2>
        
        The "I feel lucky" button automatically takes you to the first web
        page returned for your query.  When it works -- and it often works --
        it means less time searching for web pages and more time looking at
        them.
        
        
        <h2><font color="red" face="arial,helvetica"> Special Searches </font></h2>
        
        Want to limit your search to web pages regarding <a href="/web/19990221212930/http://www.google.com/linux">Linux</a>?  Interested only in web pages at <a href="stanford">Stanford</a>?  Then site search is for you.  It
        searches only a subset of the full web, providing pages that are even
        more likely to be relevant to your needs.
        
        <h2><font color="red" face="arial,helvetica"> Limitations on queries </font></h2>
        
        Google does not support all of the operations found in all search
        engines.  Many of these we plan on supporting in a future release.
        
        <ul>
        <li><b><font color="#38A808" face="arial,helvetica">No "or" operator.</font></b>
            Most search engines will return pages that
            contain only some of the query terms, sometimes in preference to
            pages that contain all the terms!  Google only returns pages that
            contain all the terms.  There is no way to turn off this
            behavior.  There is also no way to tell Google to accept pages
            containing either word A or word B.  You must submit the query
            twice, once with word A and once with word B.
        </li><li><b><font color="#38A808" face="arial,helvetica">Google doesn't
               "stem."</font></b>
            Some search engines automatically expand your search, so when you
            type in "wood" it searches for "woods" as well, and maybe even
            "woody" or "wooden."  There's some argument about whether this is
            good or bad, but Google does not support it.  If in doubt, try
            both forms: "airline" <i>and</i> "airlines," for instance.
        </li></ul>
        
        
        <h2><font color="red" face="arial,helvetica"> Stopwords </font></h2>
        
        Google removes common words such as "the" and "of" from the query
        before it starts to search.  Use "<tt>+the</tt>" or "<tt>+of</tt>" to
        prevent the common word from being removed.  This is sometimes helpful
        when the word is important for completing a phrase.<p>
        
        Since some other search engines (but not Google) use "and" and "or" as
        search operators, Google ignores them.  If you want to use "and" or "or"
        as actual query words, you can use "<tt>+and</tt>" or "<tt>+or</tt>".</p><p>
        
        Note that you need to use "+" even within quotation marks.  A query
        like <tt>"lord of the flies"</tt> will normally search for documents
        with "lord" and "flies" and any two words in between them.  You can
        use <tt>"lord +of +the flies"</tt> to force those two words to be "of"
        and "the".</p><p>
